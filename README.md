Sin√©ad Eriksson
## Description
This simple command line based program simulates a coffe machine. Users can, starting from the main menu, perform three different actions, or turn off the machine. The actions are to refill the inventory of the machine, view the inventory in the moment, and also buy drinks. There are certain requirements put on the user depending on the actions they wish to perform. These requirements, among other things, are tested in the JUnit tests included in the project. 

## Installation
Open the project in Eclipse (or equivilent IDE), for the logging Log4j is used. Furthermore the tests are based on Java Unit tests (JUnit). And for a good overview of the code coverage, EclEmma was used. 

## How To Use
The program is run through  ```CoffeeMachine.java```, simply follow the prompts in the terminal to give it a try. To only run the tests, run ```CoffeeMachineTest.java```. Logs of the execution are logged and can be found in log files in ./logs folder.
